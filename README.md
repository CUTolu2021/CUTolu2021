- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CUTolu2021
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a computer science graduate
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack development with JS, node.js,next.js and playing around with multiple low code platforms.
You could say i'm a software engineer but i don't know if i'm in love with that title.
Software dev sounds better
