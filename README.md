- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CUTolu2021
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a student at the undergraduate level studying computer science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI development with python, and playing around with multiple low code platforms.
You could say i'm a software engineer but i don't know if i'm in love with that title.
Software dev sounds better
